+Code the following app
+```
+Prompt: Create a fully functional Snake game contained in a single file.
+
+Technical Requirements:
+
+Use the HTML5 <canvas> element for the game board. Set the canvas to 400x400 pixels.
+
+Do not use any external libraries or images. Use standard CSS and JavaScript only.
+
+The game logic should rely on a grid system (e.g., 20px by 20px tiles).
+
+Game Rules:
+
+The snake starts as a chain of 3 green squares in the center.
+
+The snake moves automatically in the current direction.
+
+Use the Arrow Keys on the keyboard to change the snake's direction (Up, Down, Left, Right). Prevent the snake from reversing into itself (e.g., cannot go Left if currently going Right).
+
+Place a red square randomly on the grid to represent "Food".
+
+When the snake's head enters the same grid space as the Food:
+
+The snake grows by one square.
+
+The score increases by 1.
+
+New Food is generated in a random empty spot.
+
+Game Over Conditions: The game stops if the snake hits the walls of the canvas OR hits its own tail.
+
+Display the Score text above the canvas.
+Place the game on the home page.

+Update the existing code to improve the user interface and controls:
+
+Styling: Center the canvas on the screen. Give the page a dark gray background and the canvas a black background with a white border.
+
+Controls: Add a standard HTML <button> labeled "Start / Restart Game" below the canvas. The game should not start until this is clicked.
+
+Game Over: When the game ends, draw the text "GAME OVER" in large white letters in the center of the canvas.

+Enhance the overall UI/UX design of the Snake game with a clean, modern aesthetic.
+
+Specific UI Enhancements:
+
+Game Board:
+
+Instead of a solid black background, implement a subtle dark grid pattern on the canvas to represent the game cells, without changing the core game logic.
+
+Give the canvas a slightly rounded border and a subtle inner shadow for depth.
+
+Snake Appearance:
+
+Make the snake segments slightly rounded (like capsules or pills) rather than perfect squares.
+
+Add a subtle glow effect to the snake segments, making them look vibrant green.
+
+Food Appearance:
+
+Change the red square food to a more visually appealing icon, such as a stylized red apple or a glowing red orb.
+
+Add a subtle pulsing or glow effect to the food to make it stand out.
+
+Score Display:
+
+Refactor the score display into a clean, modern score panel. Position it clearly above the game canvas.
+
+Use a modern, legible font for the score. Add a label like "SCORE:" before the number.
+
+Start/Restart Button:
+
+Style the "Start / Restart Game" button with a modern flat or material design look.
+
+Use a contrasting but harmonious color (e.g., a bright accent color) and ensure it has a subtle hover effect.
+
+Center the button below the canvas.
+
+Game Over Message:
+
+Enhance the "GAME OVER" message. Use a more impactful font and possibly a subtle animation (e.g., fading in) when it appears.
+
+Display the final score clearly alongside the "GAME OVER" message on the canvas.
+
+Overall Theme:
+
+Maintain the dark background for the page, but ensure all UI elements (score, button) are designed to fit a cohesive, slightly futuristic or minimalist theme.
+
+Important: Ensure all visual enhancements are achieved using standard CSS and JavaScript.

+Here is the updated, complete prompt. I have added the Random Fruit Color requirement to the logic section.
+
+Prompt:
+
+Please update the Snake Game application with the following Visual Redesigns, Logic Fixes, and New Features:
+
+1. Visual Redesign: "Neon" Game Over Overlay Refactor the Game Over screen to match a modern, high-contrast neon aesthetic:
+
+Overlay Background: Use a deep, dark semi-transparent black (rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9)) so the game board is faintly visible behind it.
+
+Title Text ("GAME OVER"):
+
+Font: Large, bold, sans-serif (approx 3rem).
+
+Color: Bright Neon Red (#ff4d4d).
+
+Effect: Add a strong glowing effect using text-shadow (e.g., 0 0 10px rgba(255, 50, 50, 0.7), 0 0 20px rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)).
+
+Case: Uppercase.
+
+Score Text: White, thin font weight, with margin to separate it from the title and button.
+
+"TRY AGAIN" Button:
+
+Style: Flat, solid bright red background (#ef4444).
+
+Text: White, uppercase, bold, letter-spaced.
+
+Shape: Rectangular with slight border-radius (4px).
+
+Padding: Large and clickable (e.g., 10px 30px).
+
+2. Visual Fix: Application Title
+
+The main header "Snake Game App" is currently invisible.
+
+Fix: Change the h1 color to White (#ffffff) and add a subtle text shadow so it stands out against the dark background.
+
+3. Logic Fix: Restart Functionality
+
+The "TRY AGAIN" button inside the overlay is currently unresponsive.
+
+Fix: Ensure the button's click event listener correctly triggers the resetGame() function.
+
+Requirement: The resetGame() function must explicitly set the Overlay's display style to none so that the menu disappears immediately when the new game begins.
+
+4. New Feature: Random Fruit Colors
+
+Logic: Every time a new piece of food spawns (at the start or after being eaten), assign it a random vibrant color.
+
+Implementation: Create an array of neon colors (e.g., Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Lime, Orange) and randomly select one when generating the food object.
+
+Render: Update the draw function to use this specific color for the food instead of the static red.

+Update the visual style of the Game Over overlay to match a specific "Neon/Modern" design:
+
+1. "GAME OVER" Title Text:
+
+Font: Use a large, bold, sans-serif font (approx 3rem or 48px).
+
+Color: Use a bright salmon/red color (e.g., #ff4d4d).
+
+Glow Effect: Crucial: Add a strong red neon glow using CSS text-shadow.
+
+Example CSS: text-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(255, 50, 50, 0.7), 0 0 20px rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5);
+
+Text Transform: Uppercase.
+
+2. "Final Score" Text:
+
+Keep it simple, white, and thinner font weight. Size approx 1.2rem.
+
+Margin: Add spacing between the title and the button.
+
+3. "TRY AGAIN" Button:
+
+Background: Use a solid, flat bright red color (e.g., #ef4444).
+
+Shape: Rectangular with slightly rounded corners (e.g., border-radius: 4px).
+
+Text: White, uppercase, bold, and letter-spaced.
+
+Padding: Generous padding (e.g., 10px 30px).
+
+Border: None.
+
+4. Background Overlay:
+
+Make the overlay background very dark but slightly transparent (e.g., rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9)) so the game grid is barely visible behind it.

+Fix the critical "Game Not Starting" bug and update the snake's graphics:
+
+1. Fix Game Start Logic (Critical):
+
+Currently, the game loop is not triggering when keys are pressed.
+
+Logic Update: Modify the keydown event listener.
+
+Check if isGameRunning is false.
+
+If an arrow key is pressed while the game is stopped:
+
+Set isGameRunning to true.
+
+Immediately start the setInterval game loop.
+
+Update the snake's velocity based on the key pressed so it moves instantly.
+
+Remove any "Press Key to Start" overlay text if it exists.
+
+2. Visual Enhancement: Head & Tail:
+
+Modify the draw() function to distinguish the snake's Head and Tail from the body.
+
+The Head (snake[0]):
+
+Color: Make the head a brighter, distinct color (e.g., #66ff66 or White).
+
+Detail: Draw two small black or white dots on the head block to represent Eyes.
+
+The Body: Keep the standard green rounded rectangles.
+
+The Tail (Last Segment):
+
+Make the very last segment of the snake slightly smaller (e.g., 14px instead of 20px) or a darker shade of green to visually indicate it is the end of the tail.

+Add Mobile-Only On-Screen Controls to the game. These controls must be completely invisible on desktop computers and only appear on smaller screens.
+
+1. HTML Structure:
+
+Add a container div ID mobile-controls below the game canvas.
+
+Inside, create 4 buttons with IDs: btnUp, btnLeft, btnDown, btnRight.
+
+Use standard arrow symbols (e.g., ↑, ↓, ←, →) as the text.
+
+2. CSS Visibility (Critical):
+
+Default State (Desktop): Set #mobile-controls { display: none; }. This ensures they are hidden by default on laptops and PC monitors.
+
+Mobile State (Media Query): Add a media query for screens smaller than 768px (e.g., @media (max-width: 768px)).
+
+Inside this query, set #mobile-controls to display: grid.
+
+This ensures the buttons only appear on mobile devices or small windows.
+
+3. CSS Styling (Neon D-Pad):
+
+Grid Layout: When visible, arrange the buttons in a 3-column, 2-row grid to form a "Cross" or "D-Pad" shape:
+
+Row 1: [Empty] [Up] [Empty]
+
+Row 2: [Left] [Down] [Right]
+
+Button Style: Large square buttons (min 60px), transparent background with Neon Blue borders (1px solid #00f3ff) and white text.
+
+Touch Action: Add touch-action: manipulation; to the buttons to prevent browser zooming on double-taps.
+
+4. JavaScript Logic:
+
+Add touchstart (and click as fallback) event listeners to these buttons.
+
+Functionality:
+
+Tapping a button must trigger the same direction change as the corresponding Keyboard Arrow key.
+
+Auto-Start: Tapping a button should also set isGameRunning = true (start the game) if it hasn't started yet.
