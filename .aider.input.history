+Code the following app
+```
+Prompt: Create a fully functional Snake game contained in a single file.
+
+Technical Requirements:
+
+Use the HTML5 <canvas> element for the game board. Set the canvas to 400x400 pixels.
+
+Do not use any external libraries or images. Use standard CSS and JavaScript only.
+
+The game logic should rely on a grid system (e.g., 20px by 20px tiles).
+
+Game Rules:
+
+The snake starts as a chain of 3 green squares in the center.
+
+The snake moves automatically in the current direction.
+
+Use the Arrow Keys on the keyboard to change the snake's direction (Up, Down, Left, Right). Prevent the snake from reversing into itself (e.g., cannot go Left if currently going Right).
+
+Place a red square randomly on the grid to represent "Food".
+
+When the snake's head enters the same grid space as the Food:
+
+The snake grows by one square.
+
+The score increases by 1.
+
+New Food is generated in a random empty spot.
+
+Game Over Conditions: The game stops if the snake hits the walls of the canvas OR hits its own tail.
+
+Display the Score text above the canvas.
+Place the game on the home page.

+Update the existing code to improve the user interface and controls:
+
+Styling: Center the canvas on the screen. Give the page a dark gray background and the canvas a black background with a white border.
+
+Controls: Add a standard HTML <button> labeled "Start / Restart Game" below the canvas. The game should not start until this is clicked.
+
+Game Over: When the game ends, draw the text "GAME OVER" in large white letters in the center of the canvas.

+Enhance the overall UI/UX design of the Snake game with a clean, modern aesthetic.
+
+Specific UI Enhancements:
+
+Game Board:
+
+Instead of a solid black background, implement a subtle dark grid pattern on the canvas to represent the game cells, without changing the core game logic.
+
+Give the canvas a slightly rounded border and a subtle inner shadow for depth.
+
+Snake Appearance:
+
+Make the snake segments slightly rounded (like capsules or pills) rather than perfect squares.
+
+Add a subtle glow effect to the snake segments, making them look vibrant green.
+
+Food Appearance:
+
+Change the red square food to a more visually appealing icon, such as a stylized red apple or a glowing red orb.
+
+Add a subtle pulsing or glow effect to the food to make it stand out.
+
+Score Display:
+
+Refactor the score display into a clean, modern score panel. Position it clearly above the game canvas.
+
+Use a modern, legible font for the score. Add a label like "SCORE:" before the number.
+
+Start/Restart Button:
+
+Style the "Start / Restart Game" button with a modern flat or material design look.
+
+Use a contrasting but harmonious color (e.g., a bright accent color) and ensure it has a subtle hover effect.
+
+Center the button below the canvas.
+
+Game Over Message:
+
+Enhance the "GAME OVER" message. Use a more impactful font and possibly a subtle animation (e.g., fading in) when it appears.
+
+Display the final score clearly alongside the "GAME OVER" message on the canvas.
+
+Overall Theme:
+
+Maintain the dark background for the page, but ensure all UI elements (score, button) are designed to fit a cohesive, slightly futuristic or minimalist theme.
+
+Important: Ensure all visual enhancements are achieved using standard CSS and JavaScript.
